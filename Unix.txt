cp is copy
	cp test.txt two.txt
	test.txt two.txt
to rename a file is mv, 
	mv test.txt one.txt
	one.txt two.txt
cp and mv can be used to add files together
	cp one.txt two.txt three.txt four.txt
cat, look at the contents of a file
	cat one.txt
	Hellow World!
cat one.txt > four.txt
cat two.txt>>four.txt
cat three.txt>>four.txt
cat four.txt
	Hellow World!

Commands that are fun

dd

-shows disk or file usage
du
-estimate file space
-Summarize disk usage of the set of FILEs, recursively for directories.

echo $PATH - shows the path for each main location
-nate@nate-1025C:~$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin

nate@nate-1025C:~$ export $prooj
nate@nate-1025C:~$ export proof=false
nate@nate-1025C:~$ echo $proof
false
 
 
 env && export
 - Both allow you to take a value and keep it over multiple prompts.
 my
 k4dirstat - helps show the size of files in a directory
 
 tape archive -not a command
 - allows you to backup files onto tapes using tar
 
nate@nate-1025C:~/Documents/UNIX$ tar -cf examples.tar examples
nate@nate-1025C:~/Documents/UNIX$ ls *tar
examples.tar


zip
- gzip or zipfile liple zip welsh
- Lossless, it takes up way less space than the average file
- it essentially goes through each file in the main file and zips them all together.
- the zip has breathed new life into the tape archive because it compresses the entire archive and loses less data
- Compressed - uses a zip library over a browser to send information using less bytes

tar.gz
-to get to the file you must unzip then untar it

ifconfig (internet family configuration)
-

iwlist

WEP
- Wifi Encryption Protection
WPA
- 
WPS
- WiFi Protrection Service
PSK
- Pre Shared Key
AES
- encryption software that allows your password hidden, highly reccomended for 
phones because its the only thing usually your phone can handle.

All routers come up with their own ip addresses.
LAN - Local Area Network
WAN - Wide Area Network

WAT - 
		
DNS - Domain Name Server
ping 
- you can ping an ip address
to go outside your DNS has to go to an ISP and that goes to a root NS

the traceroute allows you to find many ip's and then can nslookup that ip to find who owns that ip.

inputattach 
- can be used to attach a device to the computer.s
google-chrome- -- kiosk sitename it opens webpage in kiosk mode (a page with a limited amount of vision)

LAMP stands for Linux, Apache, Mysql, Php/Perl


to chage the file test.txt from rwxrwxrwx to rwxr xr x you would use sudo chmod 755 test.txt

mkfs is used to make a file system

ln can be used to make hard and soft links

using Unix mout ot make a disk drive part of the root file system

dmesg | tail shows the last ten lines of the system messages

the cat command is useful for dumping configuration files to the screen, looking at an output from a serial device, seeing the content of any file in the system
